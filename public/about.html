<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm a 30 years old professional barista and hobby web developer. 
  My dream is to leave the reins of a coffee machine to my younger colleagues and fully immerse myself in the world of IT.
</p>

<p>Right now I'm learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript, figuring out the massive world of web development.</p>

<p>
  Apart from web develompment, I love playing good videogames, especially role-playing games and multiplayer online RPGs.
  If you find yourself playing a lot of Final Fantasy XIV, hit me up and we can play together sometimes!
