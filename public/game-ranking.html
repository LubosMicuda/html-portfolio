<h1>Best games ever according to Lubos</h1>
<h2>My top 5 videogames of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Baldur's Gate 3</h3>
<p>The best RPG game with deep story, where choices really matter and almost every character reacts to your deeds.</p>
<h3>World of Warcraft</h3>
<p>An MMORPG game I grew up playing. The game will soon be turning 20 years old, but it's still reigning as the most played game in its genre.</p>
<h3>The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim</h3>
<p>An epic RPG with unrivalled freedom and massive open world. It's modding community is very active and you can literally make this game your own.</p>
<h3>Final Fantasy XIV</h3>
<p>Another MMORPG on this list is 10 years younger, although for all you story-oriented, this one has a lot deeper story than WoW, and is very very much viable to be played solo all the way down to the endgame.</p>
<h3>The Mass Effect Trilogy</h3>
<p>When I want a break from my favourite medieval fantasy setting, I pick up this sci-fi fantasy masterpiece. The fourth installment is a bit lacking, but the original trilogy is very much worth playing through. Even several times.</p>
